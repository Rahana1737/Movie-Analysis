# Movie Industry Performance & Profitability Analysis
Interactive Power BI Dashboard Project
Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of a movie dataset, starting with data cleaning in Microsoft Excel (Power Query) and progressing to advanced visualization in Power BI.
The raw dataset contained missing values, duplicate values and inconsistent format. Using Excel Power Query, the data was cleaned, standardized, and transformed to ensure accuracy and reliability before importing it into Power BI for modeling and analysis.
After cleaning, the dataset was used to build an interactive dashboard that analyzes:
Movie profitability
Revenue and budget trends
Genre performance
Director impact on financial success
IMDb rating distribution

This project demonstrates practical skills in:
Data Cleaning using Excel Power Query
Data Transformation & Standardization
Data Modeling in Power BI
DAX Calculations
Business-Oriented Data Visualization

Data Preparation (Power Query)
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query:
Create a index column named Movie_id
Removed duplicate records using Movie_id
Handled missing values in budget, gross, and IMDb score
Corrected data types (Year, Decimal, Whole Number)
This ensured accurate reporting and reliable insights.
